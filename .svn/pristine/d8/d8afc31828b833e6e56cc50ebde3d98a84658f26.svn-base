We added the following:
1.) Implemented menu screen. This was a relatively difficult task as we had to
research how to do this. The way we did it is by wrapping the game's rendering with
if statements and compare them to an enum value. This allows us to also render
specific screens. Thus, by creating many if statements and separate screens, we 
are able to create a type of menu system. 6 hours.
2.) Sprites. This was pretty easy to implement. It was tedious to get the spritesheet
designed correctly ("spritesheet.png") because if we do not have a proper grid
on our sheet, then when it comes around to being rendered, some of the monsters 
would not look as well as they do. They might have overlapping images or be 
off-centered. 4 hours. 
3.) Multiple bug fixes. This week we realized how poorly we designed our game.
We found multiple issues with our code. Some of them were trickier to fix than
others. For example, whenever the body of the centipede was hit, and a new 
centipede would be created, the head would be a block ahead from the rest of the 
centipede. We found that this was due to the new head being rendered much later
than the body. We fixed this by forcing each head to be rendered first. 5 hours.
