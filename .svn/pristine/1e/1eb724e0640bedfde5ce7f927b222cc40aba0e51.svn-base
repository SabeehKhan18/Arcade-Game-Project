As of 11:00 AM, on this day of 5/6/15, we have some implementation 
of the following:
1.) Collision, but spaceship can move diagonally through. 2 hours.
2.) Switching and Loading levels. 2 hours.
3.) Firing with one weapon. 1 hour. 

Our collision is really bad, as we test many cases. We should create 
a method that will detect collision of everything and return boolean.
This will be implemented in Movable.
